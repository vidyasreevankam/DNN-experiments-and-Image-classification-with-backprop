# DNN-experiments-and-Image-classification-with-backprop
The files train.py, report.pdf,run.sh,test_submission,supported.txt belong to Image classification gradient descent with back propagation. It is completely
implemented in python. You can run it by python train.py by making necessary changes in the directories. The dataset can be found here https://www.kaggle.com/c/iitm-dl18-pa1 /

# DNN experiments
In the Deep Neural network experiments you can see the experiments using CNN and autoencoder. Its mainly trying out various architectures for Deep Neural networks by learning one object 
at a time. You can find them in the necessary .ipynb files. You can place any image datasets and work it out.\
Keep Enjoying by experimenting with various combinations of Auto encoders, CNN and check out the validation accuracy.
